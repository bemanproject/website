# My Blog Example

This is my blog example.

Here I can write Markdown content.

I can also include code blocks:

```cpp
int main() { return 0; }
```

I can also include `blog post local images`:

![Beman logo](./images/beman_logo.png)

Or I can also include `website global available images`:

![Beman logo reversed](../../images/logos/beman_logo_reversed.png)

I can also include links:

[Beman Project](https://bemanproject.org)
