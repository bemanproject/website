## Progress on Execution Library

A small group had a look at _sequence senders_ and started with some basic implementation (not, yet, on Beman repositories but [here](https://github.com/dietmarkuehl/sequence_next), awaiting a bit more substance and a proposal) built on top of [`execution`](https://github.com/bemanproject/execution): senders are fundamentally a "pull model" (you ask for work) and sequence senders expand that to add a "push model" (you get work given).
